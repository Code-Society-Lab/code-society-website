## Contribution
As always, we invite everyone to participate in the development of our projects. Nevertheless, we are a bit less prone to accept Pull Request since this project directly represent the code society. 
In other words, we'll be more rigid on the acceptation criteria, however, we'll be more than happy to check your PR and ideas (issues).

Before contributing please refer to our [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Code-Society-Lab/grace/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct for contributor (temporary unavailable)](#).
